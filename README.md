crystal-game

This is a game where the player is shown a number and four crystals are displayed as buttons on the page.  Each crystal has a hidden number value.  When the player clicks on a crystal, it adds a specific amount of points to the player's total score.  The number value of the crystal is always hidden so the player must remember what the value is.  The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.  The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
